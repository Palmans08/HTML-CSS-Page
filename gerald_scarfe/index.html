                        <p class="border_left"><strong>Gerald Anthony Scarfe</strong> CBE, RDI (born 1 June 1936) is an English cartoonist and illustrator. He has worked as editorial cartoonist for The Sunday Times and illustrator for The New Yorker.
                        </p>

                        <p class="border_right">His other work includes graphics for rock group Pink Floyd, particularly on their 1979 album The Wall, its 1982 film adaptation, and tour (1980–81), as well as the music video for "Welcome to the Machine". Scarfe was the production
                            designer on the Disney animated feature Hercules (1997). Scarfe also provided the opening titles for Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister.

                        <h1>Early life</h1>
                        <p class="border_left"> Scarfe was born in St John's Wood, London. As Scarfe was severely asthmatic as a child, he spent many of his early years bed-ridden, so drawing became a means of entertainment as well as a creative outlet. Scarfe speculated that
                            the dark and grotesque images that often characterise his work are a result of his loneliness and asthma. Scarfe has stated that the irreverence apparent in much of his work can be traced back to "dodgy treatments" and a reliance
                            on what he feels were incompetent doctors.
                        </p>

                        <p class="border_right">The cartoonist Ronald Searle was an early influence for Scarfe. At the age of 14 and now living in Hampstead, North London, Scarfe decided it would be easy to cycle to Bayswater and visit Searle. He went several times but never
                            rang the doorbell. It would be decades before he would actually meet Searle in 2005. Scarfe attended Saint Martin's School of Art (now part of the University of the Arts London) in Holborn, London. He also attended the London
                            College of Printing, and East Ham Technical College (now Newham College of Further Education).</p>

                        <h1>Awards and accolades</h1>
                        <p class="border_left">On 22 November 2005 the United Kingdom's Press Gazette named its 40 most influential journalists, and included Scarfe alongside just two other cartoonists, Carl Giles, and Matt Pritchett.</p>
                        <p class="border_mid">Scarfe was awarded 'Cartoonist of the Year' at the British Press Awards 2006.</p>
                        <p class="border_mid">Scarfe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.
                        </p>
                        <p class="border_right">In 2011, a fossil pterosaur discovered in Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset, was named Cuspicephalus scarfi in his honour.</p>

                            with that period in time.</p>

                        <p>I think that an artist is a bit like a computer. He receives information from the world around him and from his past and from his own experiences. And it all goes into the brain.
