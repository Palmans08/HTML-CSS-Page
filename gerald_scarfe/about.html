                    <h1>Early work</h1>
                    <p class="border_left">After briefly working in advertising, a profession he grew to dislike intensely, Scarfe's early
                        caricatures of public figures were published in satirical magazine Private Eye throughout the
                        1960s
                        and 1970s. Beginning in 1960, he produced illustrations for Punch, The Evening Standard and The
                        Daily Sketch. The Sunday Times magazine assigned Scarfe to cover the 1964 US presidential
                        election.
                        He continued to work for The Sunday Times for two years, also producing several cover
                        illustrations
                        for Time magazine, including caricatures of The Beatles in 1967.</p>

                    <p class="border_right"> In the mid-1960s he took a job at the Daily Mail following a Dutch auction for his services with
                        the
                        Daily Express. His decision to work for the Daily Mail led to his estrangement from fellow
                        cartoonist Ralph Steadman, alongside whom he had studied art at East Ham Technical College. Soon
                        after, Steadman was commissioned to illustrate Scarfe and "produced an image that was half saint
                        and
                        half Superman, but with a disconnected heart". Scarfe spent only one year working for the Daily
                        Mail, during which time he was sent to provide illustrations from the Vietnam War. </p>

                <h1>Pink Floyd and Roger Waters</h1>
                <section>

                    <p class="border_left">Scarfe was approached to work with Pink Floyd after Roger Waters and Nick Mason both saw his
                        animated BBC film A Long Drawn Out Trip. Pink Floyd's 1974 programme for their tour in the
                        UK
                        and US, in the form of a comic, included a centre-spread caricature of the band. Scarfe
                        later
                        produced a set of animated short clips used on the 1977 In The Flesh tour, including a
                        full-length music video for the song Welcome to the Machine.</p>


                    <p class="border_left">Scarfe also drew the illustrations for their 1979 album The Wall and provided animation and
                        stage
                        props, including enormous inflatable characters for the subsequent 1980–1981 concert tour in
                        support of that album. In 1982, he worked on the film version of The Wall, although he and
                        Roger
                        Waters fell out with director Alan Parker during the latter stages of editing. As well as
                        the
                        artwork, Scarfe contributed 15 minutes' worth of elaborate animation to the film, including
                        a
                        sequence depicting the German bombing campaign over England during World War II, set to the
                        song
                        "Goodbye Blue Sky". Some of the animated footage was not original to the film, having been
                        produced for and used in the 1980–81 concert tour, as well as being featured in the 1979
                        music
                        video for "Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2".</p>

                    <p class="border_right">Scarfe continued to work with Roger Waters after the latter left Pink Floyd, creating the
                        graphics and animation for Waters' solo album The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984) and
                        its
                        supporting tour. Scarfe was also involved in subsequent theatrical adaptations of The Wall,
                        including The Wall Concert in Berlin (1990), and Waters' worldwide The Wall Live (2010-2013)
                        tour, where his animations were projected on a vast scale. Scarfe's collaboration with
                        Waters
                        was marked in 2008 by the release of a signed limited-edition eight-print series, "Scarfe on
                        the
                        Wall", which contained a monograph book with an extended new interview with Scarfe and was
                        signed by Roger Waters. Early editions of "Scarfe on The Wall" (by date of pre-order, not
                        issue
                        number) came with an additional print giving a total of nine in the set - making these the
                        rarest and most valuable sets. In 2010, Scarfe's book The Making of Pink Floyd: The Wall was
                        published, detailing the artist's work with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters from 1974 to 2010.
                        The
                        book contains contributions from Floyd members Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and David Gilmour,
                        as
                        well as director of the film, Alan Parker. </p>

                            Musker,
                            longtime fans who had risen to prominence within Disney following the success of The Little
                            Mermaid.
                            Scarfe worked as a conceptual character artist, designing almost all of the characters and
                            then
                            supervising the 900 Disney artists charged with adapting his designs for the film.</p>

                            April 1998. Honoring English comedians, the stamps feature Scarfe caricatures of Tommy

                        <p class="border_mid">Scarfe has designed sets for a number of operatic productions, including an adaptation of
                            Roald
                            Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox. Following a chance meeting at a BBC prom he worked with Peter Hall

                            his

                            animation for Jim Steinman's Bat Out of Hell, a stage show featuring Steinman's music.
                            Scarfe
                            designed the sets and costumes for the English National Opera's 1988 production of Orpheus

                            and

                            of a

                            villainous
                            attributes. Amongst the over 30 portraits he depicted included caricatures of Henry VIII,
                            Winston
                            Churchill, Queen Elizabeth I, Pete Best, Richard Branson, Adam Smith, William Blake, The

                            Agatha Christie and Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2009, he also created a caricature of James

                        <h1>Netanyahu cartoon</h1>
                        <p class="border_left">In its edition of 27 January 2013 <strong><em>(Britain's Holocaust Memorial Day)</em></strong>, London's Sunday Times
                            published
                            a cartoon by Scarfe depicting Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paving a wall with
                            the
                            blood and bodies of Palestinians, captioned "Israeli elections—will cementing peace
                            continue?"
                            The
                            cartoon's timing and content was criticised by groups including the European Jewish Congress
                            and
                            the
                            Board of Deputies of British Jews, with accusations of antisemitism leveled against Scarfe.
                        </p>
                        <p class="border_mid">Unaware the cartoon would appear on Holocaust Memorial Day, Scarfe argued that the cartoon
                            was
                            clearly aimed specifically at Netanyahu and his policies, and were in response to his
                            election,
                            rather than being related to Holocaust Memorial Day. The newspaper's proprietor, Rupert
                            Murdoch,
                            apologised for the cartoon on Twitter, and acting editor Martin Ivens promised to be more
                            vigilant
                            in future.</p>
                        <p class="border_right">The cartoon was published in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, where Anshel Pfeffer discusses
                            the
                            cartoon in great detail, giving four reasons why, in his opinion, the cartoon is not
                            antisemitic.
                            Writer Howard Jacobson claimed the cartoon was not antisemitic. British Chief Rabbi Lord
                            Sacks
                            condemned the cartoon.</p>
