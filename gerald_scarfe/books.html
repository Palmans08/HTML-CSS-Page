                        <h1>Long Drawn Out Trip</h1>
                        <p>In this fascinating memoir Gerald Scarfe tells his life story for the first time. With
                            captivating, often thrilling stories, he takes us back to his wartime childhood and the
                            terrible
                            curse of asthma, through his days as an advertising draughtsman, to his field reporting in
                            Vietnam and the giddy highs of rock and roll. He also reveals the process of cartooning -
                            and
                            the ways that certain subjects have reacted to his visions of them. Along the way he has
                            been
                            car-jacked in Derry, dined with royals and thoroughly upset Mrs Mary Whitehouse. It is a
                            very
                            personal, wickedly funny and caustically insightful account of an artist's life at the
                            forefront
                            of contemporary culture and society. Hand signed by Gerald Scarfe. Hardback, 280 pages.</p>
